    </header>

    <p>
        Using Good and sensible variable names is very important in a software developer's carrer.<br>
It makes you to write good code and be a world-class developer in the run.<br>
<br>
Following things should be taken care of while assigning names to your variables<br>
<br>
1. MUST USE INTENTION-REVEALING NAMES<br>
	i.e the variable name should be self-explanatory about what the variable does <br>
    <br> It must tell :-<br> 
	a. the reason of existense of the variable<br>
	b. what does the variable do<br>
	c. how is the variable used<br>
    <br>
Why? <br>
because in a team there are multiple people contributing to the same project at same time<br>
and with some random variable name one will have a hard time reading/understanding our code<br>
	even we ourselves may forget,<br> 
		what is that 'z' variable meant for? <br>
        <br>
Good variable names help to make keep your code alive forever i.e it is useful always  <br>
<br>
Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand and change the code.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
2. Different variables should be named such that one can distinguish in between them <br>
	since they are different so needless to say they must appear different too. <br>
    <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
3. Must use easily-pronounceable names<br>
<br>
because codes are usually discussed it a team and you need to use tha name frequently <br>
but if you can't utter the name easily, you won't be able to dicuss it with ease.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
4. Must use searchable names
so that if you are facing a bug in a application which you coded a year back then<br>
<br>you should be able to go and search on basis of general instinct
<br>	because there are high chances that you forget
<br>	
<br>	about the name which you gave to the variable 
<br>		which was holding details of the richest person in the town
<br>			was it 'x' or 'richestInTown'.
<br>
and yeah did I mention that some other random developer might also sit down to debug that application.<br>
how will he search?<br>
by ringing you up in the midnight to ask the name of that variable.........??<br>
	Choice is yours<br>
    <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
5. Avoid encoding<br>
<br>
Write names such that even a dumb person is able to understand your code<br>
Leave it to the final layer to encode your code and take care of the security vulnerabilities
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
6. Avoid Mental Mappings<br>
<br>
The variables name should be such that you don't have to remember that
<br>	 why this piece of variable is used here 
<br>also use domain-specific names so that the names aren't generic and you don't have to struggle to get a clear
<br>idea of the meaning of the variable name  
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>7. Class Names and Method names
<br>
<br>Use nouns  ->  for classes and objects namings
<br>use verbs  ->  for methods namings
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>8. Use Memorable names
<br>
<br>we should use universal names for variable names.
<br>Not slangs or words which only a few people understand 
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>9. Pick one word per concept
<br>
<br>Either delete or remove -> to delete a object
<br>choose one word for deleting a object and use that same word through-out the code
<br>Be consistent with the word you choose
<br>
<br>Consistency is the key here
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>10. Don't Pun  
<br>
<br>We shouldn't use the same word for two differnt purposes
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>11. Use Solution and Problem Domain Names
<br>
<br>While writing variable if some technical term and be used which is obvious to the 
<br>programmers world to understand , then use it
<br>	Don't dive deep to be domain specific.
<br>
<br>Don't be cold-blooded for your own community Programmers
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>12. Add meaningful contexts
<br>
<br>Add some prefixes to variable name so that it gives more clear idea of the context
<br>either use a class to encapsulate them 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>13. If you find any variable name in somebody else's code which can be renamed to be a better version then change it.
<br>Don't be scared, 
<br>You are doing good Man!
<br> Go for it.....!!!
